This is just a example for generating random numbers and plotting them in a graph and to see whether random points generated are in clusters or not.

To change the numbers of points on graph change the value of 'i' on line no 36 of file PaintExampleFrame.java 

A screenshot is taken at the end of the program and a sample screenshot is also included and the outputs are saved in output.txt file.

The points are plotted in a window where origin starts from the top left of the screen.
	Occurences of a point and color:
		1. Red
		2. Blue
		3. Green
		4. Yellow
		Others not done because I haven't even seen Green or yellow colors yet.
To run the program:
	make
In Windows:
	javac Random.java PaintExampleFrame.java
	java Random
